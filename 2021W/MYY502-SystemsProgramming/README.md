# University Winter2021 Exercises 502

This Repository will store all of the Lab Exercises for my University Lecture on "Systems Programming" in C programming Language.  
The **First** commit of each Folder (after Lab4) will be what I managed to do within the 1 hour and 20 minutes time-frame thats given to us.  
Any Subsequent commits on the **same Folders** will include work that I did on my free time to complete/improve on the code for the Exercises.  
The Exercises are inside the '*Lab1ExercisesEN*' pdf file (Theres currently only versions in Greek. I will translate them when I have time.)  
Also check the README.md inside the folders (if any) for further details/clarifications.  

Will I finish the un-finished exercises? Maybe  
Will I improve the already completed exercises? Possible
